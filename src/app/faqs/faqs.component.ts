  {name:"Do I have lifetime access to the content?",ans:"You will have access to the content for 1 year."},
  {name:"I have a jam-packed schedule and I am not sure if I can make it, what do you suggest?",ans:"You will have access to the on-demand content to watch whenever you want. You will only need to get into the live sessions but even if you canâ€™t make it, we provide all the recordings. So, mostly we expect you to put in 4-6 hours a week to complete the program successfully."}]
